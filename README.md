### Dependencies and others
* The only dependency I have used are (create-react-app, react-router-dom and prettier).
* Used SASS for css and OOP style with typescript
* Global State, local-storage for app data store and session-storage is used for sign in user.
* I used class component as I love OOP and separation of concern, I want everything to be separate.
* I want to write code that doesn't take long to make changes or add new features too.

### More information
* Because of time and this is just a test project, I didn't implement everything, But I could add more feature if needed or requested.
Thanks for giving me the opportunity, and the chance to take part.
